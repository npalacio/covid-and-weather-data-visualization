# covid-and-weather-data-visualization

This repository is for my Masters Capstone Project. This project is a data visualization tool whose purpose would be to enable a classroom activity where students are tasked with investigating weather's role in the COVID-19 pandemic.

The full project proposal can be found [here](./Documentation/ProjectProposal.pdf).
