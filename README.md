# COVID-19 and Weather Data Visualization

This repository is for my (Nick Palacio's) Masters Capstone Project. This project is a data visualization tool whose purpose would be to enable a classroom activity where students are tasked with investigating weather's role in the COVID-19 pandemic. This tool is a web application that will be implemented using Angular, .NET 5 and Azure.
